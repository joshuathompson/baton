## NOTE: You can't change songs, volume, etc without Spotify premium due to a limit on their web API

## Install

Fetch the release for your platform [from the following page](https://github.com/joshuathompson/baton/releases). Use `chmod` to set permissions on your binary and move it to `/usr/local/bin` or equivalent.

## Setup

Use the `baton auth` command to perform an initial setup. The command will take you through the process but you will need to login to the [Spotify API dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login), create an app, and set it up with a redirect URL of http://localhost:15298/callback.

This process will generate a long-lasting refresh token and ideally will never have to be repeated.

## Building

To build the program, simply run `make` or `make build`, this will build for all 3 platforms (note: to do this on windows you'll need [Make for windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)). To build for one specific platform run `make <platform>` where platform is either "windows", "darwin" (for MacOS) or "linux". You can also run from source by running `make run`.
